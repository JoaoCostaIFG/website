A super simple cake recipe that grandmother taught me and I love.

My grandmother likes baking this simple cake when she has grandchildren over. It
is simple and super quick to bake. For this recipe, we need:

- 8 eggs
- 1.5 cups of sugar
- 2.5 cups flour
- 1.5 cups of milk
- Small spoon of yeast

We mix all these ingredients and bake it for 55 minutes at 180 degrees in the
oven (not-preheated).  
Note: You can easily multiply/divide the quantities of ingredients to adapt the
size of the cake. Have fun and stay safe :P
