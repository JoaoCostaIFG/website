title: "Draw UML diagrams with PlantUML"
date: '2020-06-20'
---

The second semester is starting and I now have a Data-Bases class (will refer to
it as BDAD from here on). In this class we're making heavy use of
[UML](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/), more specifically
[UML class diagrams](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams-overview.html).
I am using PlantUML for that, so I'll talk about it and why I chose it.

## How I've used UML before

Up until this semester, I haven't used UML that much. As a matter of fact, I
only used UML for a project on the last semester and it was a really limited UML
application. Even with this new university class, I've been drawing my UML with
pencil and paper (like most people I see). Needless to say that this isn't
exactly efficient, specially when I need to correct mistakes.  
 Before talking about [**PlantUML**](https://plantuml.com/), I believe I should talk
about the other alternatives I've tried that (I liked) and why I didn't stick to
them.

## [draw.io](https://www.draw.io)

**Draw.io** is great for those moments when you're not in your usual working
environment and need a quick diagram drawing tool, or when you only need to draw
diagrams very sporadically.  
 It is most often used as a web-application, but it also has a desktop version that
I never tried. From what a friend told me, it is the same as the web app, but it
can be used offline.

The things I loved the most about **draw.io** are:

- It is open [source](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio);
- It is an instance of what I like calling _"a good web app"_. It works on the
  [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org), even with all cookies blocked and
  non-free **javascript** disabled;
- It is extremely user-friendly and _straight to the point_.

My problem with it was that it didn't support _association classes_: it neither
has the type of arrows needed, nor allows to connect an arrow to another.

## [Modelio](https://www.modelio.org/)

I'm going to be honest, I didn't have high expectations for this one since it
was recommended by my teachers. Still, it is open-source, extensible, and seems
to have a decent community that keeps the project alive.

It had a lot of dependencies that I didn't have installed and was extremely slow
when creating a project on my machine, so I gave up on it. I thought about not
listing it here since I almost didn't try it. Still, I believe you should give
it a try if you're looking for a GUI application, because you might have more
luck with it than I did.

## [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia)

I thought I was going to hate **dia** (because Gnome), but it surprised me. I
didn't need to install any dependencies and the GUI was simple and fast. Even
without having ever looked/read about at it before, all options I wanted were in
the places I expected them to be.

It is an [open-source](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dia) project, but looks a
bit abandoned. The few recent commits are mostly fixes/additions to translation
efforts. Either way, it looks fairly complete.

Remember the _association classes_ problem I had with **draw.io**? I had the
same problem with **dia**. I found
[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6139951/how-to-draw-an-association-class-in-dia/14344657#14344657)
answer on a _stackoverflow_ post dating back to the beginning of 2013. It says
that the _development branch_ of **dia** added the ability to connect UML arrows
to one another.  
 I cloned and built the _development branch_ and I can confirm that it does indeed
add that ability. The question now is why isn't this function in the _release/master_
branch after (at least) 7 years.  
 Anyway, **dia** doesn't have the UML arrow I need for this either way, so it
didn't solve the problem completely. The auto-routing is also somewhat bad,
which meant the search would go continue.

## [Umbrello](https://umbrello.kde.org/)

This program is amazing and I recommend it to anyone that feels comfortable
using GUI's and doesn't care about program sizes. It is open-source, supports
code translation from and to UML for many programming languages, and can easily
and seamlessly handle UML _association classes_ and their arrows.

Although **umbrello** has all this great things, it is huge. Definitely too huge
for me and for what I think it should be. In my machines, I need to install
**32** dependencies to use **umbrello**, so I stuck with **dia** for a while.

## Goodbye GUI's

So after all that search, I kept using **dia** on the _development branch_ with
some weird arrows (that weren't even on the UML set) to connect the _association
classes_. It was still better than drawing everything by hand.  
 When I'm drawing a UML _class diagram_ from a textual description (BDAD exercises),
I start by writing a _relational model_ as I'm reading the text. This got me thinking.
I had read about drawing UML diagrams in LaTeX before. Maybe I would be able to combine
the steps of writing the _relational model_ and drawing the _class diagram_ into
one (and show off to my friends). Turns out I can with **PlantUML**.

### [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)

**PlantUML** is open-source and strives to be as compact as possible. This means
that you only have the base set of features by default (which means you're just
missing some output formats). If you want/need some other features, you can
install the dependencies. I love this design choice.

The greatest thing about **PlantUML** is that you describe the UML diagrams
using a special textual syntax (similar to a scripting language). I know this
may sound really weird (it sounded weird to me), but it's great. You can draw
UML diagrams faster than with GUI applications and still watch live previews of
your work:

- a
  [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml);
- many vim plugins like:
  [plantuml previewer vim](https://github.com/weirongxu/plantuml-previewer.vim),
  [plantuml-syntax](https://github.com/aklt/plantuml-syntax) and
  [vim-slumlord](https://github.com/scrooloose/vim-slumlord);
- output the UML to PDF and use a PDF viewer that can update the shown contents
  automatically, like
  [Zathura](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zathura_(document_viewer)>):
  `plantuml -tpdf <file_name>`;
- use the included **PlantUML** GUI: `plantuml -gui`;
- just output to default png format and use an image viewer;
- integrates with [LaTeX](https://plantuml.com/latex);
- or try one of the [tools](https://plantuml.com/running) listed on their
  website.

There are also [tools](https://plantuml.com/running) for generation code from
and to **PlantUML** like
[hpp2plantuml](https://github.com/thibaultmarin/hpp2plantuml).

### PlantUML's examples

```js
@startuml
title Basic syntax example

'this is a comment'
class Name {
  name
}

class ID {
  id
}

/'
this is a class with some parameters
and 1 method
'/
class Person {
  name
  id
  getID()
}

'these are generalization arrows'
Person <|-- Name
'this arrow has the same meaning as the one above'
Person ^-- ID

'this is an association arrow'
Person - Car
'this is an association class arrow'
(Person, Car) .. IsOwner

@enduml
```

The 'code' above is a really simple example of PlantUML's syntax that produces
the following image when the command `plantuml <file_name>` is run:

![Basic UML example](../_resources/b25a2e2d9fa7ae33c0efc1e58983e237.png)

The [colors/themes](https://bschwarz.github.io/puml-themes/) are all
customizable, you can define the directions of the arrows, and you can tell
**PlantUML** to group certain 'objects' together, so you can end up with
something that looks like this (I'm sorry for your eyes):

![Ugly colors example](../_resources/7c51f73f1abd04ee2792786565caed4d.png)

This is the 'new code' to get the result above:

```js
@startuml

skinparam backgroundcolor Black/Orange

skinparam class {
  BackgroundColor PaleGreen
  ArrowColor SeaGreen
  BorderColor SpringGreen
}

title Ugly colors example\nwith arrow directions

'this is a comment'
class Name {
  name
}

class ID {
  id
}

/'
this is a class with some parameters
and 1 method
'/
class Person {
  name
  id
  getID()
}

'you can change the direction of arrows'
Name -down-^ Person
'you can abreviate (d)own, (u)p, (l)eft and (r)ight'
Person ^-u- ID

'this is an association arrow'
Person -l- Car
'this is an association class arrow'
(Person, Car) .. IsOwner

@enduml
```

I'm not going to talk about all the syntax in depth because I don't need to.
**PlantUML's**
[language specification](https://plantuml.com/sitemap-language-specification) is
very well written, explicit and filled with examples. The syntax is so simple
and easy that you should be able to start drawing mundane UML _class diagrams_
just by looking at the examples above and checking the syntax for the different
[UML arrows](https://plantuml.com/class-diagram). It really is that easy.

### The bad

If you're collaborating with other people, you'll probably not be able to get
them to use **PlantUML**, considering that most people prefer GUI's for
everything. This means that you'll likely only benefit from the time invested
learning the syntax when working in personal projects. Although the auto-routing
is quite good (most of the time), and you have options to group 'objects' and
choose the direction of the arrows, I still find that the diagrams don't always
look perfect. I believe this probably happens because I'm a new user, so I'm
just missing experience with the program to get everything looking the way I
want. Either way, this is the biggest barrier to entry on **PlantUML**. You have
to rely quite a lot on the auto-routing because you can't simply drag the
connections around. Sadly, it looks like **PlantUML** doesn't support (at the
time of writing)
[_association qualifiers_](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/property.html#qualifier).
Good thing I haven't needed them (yet).

## Closing remarks

After a lot of reading, searching, and trying out different programs, I found
**PlantUML** and I'm in love with it. It reminds me a lot of when I first used
**markdown**. I was skeptical, but ended up liking it. If you need to draw UML
diagrams for a project and you can decide the tool used, I recommend
**PlantUML**. It is fun, simple to use, free, it feels familiar to programming,
and it has many tools, plugins and programs that integrate with it. It is just
great. This post wasn't very 'technical', because I didn't find the need for it.
I just wanted to share my opinions on **PlantUML** and maybe convince people to
use it. I wouldn't be able to do a better job at explaining how to use
**PlantUML** than its
[documentation/language specification](https://plantuml.com/sitemap-language-specification).
On another note, I started using a _Makefile_ to deploy my website changes,
instead of my
[old deploy script](https://www.joaocosta.dev/blog/how_create_page/#my-deploy-script).
I'm still pondering if I should edit that post, so it would also include the
_Makefile_, but for now I'll leave it here.

```js
# your output directory (e.g.: public)
OUTPUT_DIR = public
# your website url (e.g.: www.joaocosta.dev)
CNAME = www.joaocosta.dev

default: server

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	@echo "cleaning"
	@# clean all files (except hidden files like '.git')
	rm -rf ${OUTPUT_DIR}/*
	mkdir -p ${OUTPUT_DIR}
	@# write the CNAME file
	printf "%s" ${CNAME} > ${OUTPUT_DIR}/CNAME

.PHONY: build
build:
	@echo "building"
	hugo -d ${OUTPUT_DIR}

.PHONY: commit
commit:
	git -C ${OUTPUT_DIR} add -A
	git -C ${OUTPUT_DIR} commit -m "Deploy: $(shell date)"
	git -C ${OUTPUT_DIR} push origin master

.PHONY: deploy
deploy: clean build commit

.PHONY: server
server:
	hugo -D server
```

Stay safe :P
