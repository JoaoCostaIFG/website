Just a few tests to check site component's functionality.

This is just a sample page that is slightly extending what's done in the [Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start) guide for HUGO. Below is some sample C code to test [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) syntax highlighting.

```c
int main(void) {
  puts("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
```
