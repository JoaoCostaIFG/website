The blog is quickly approaching what I want it to be, so I can finally write actual blog posts. So why not start by talking about how this page came to be and how you can create a similar one.

## Initial idea

The blog is quickly approaching what I want it to be, so I can finally write actual blog posts. So why not start by talking about how this page came to be and how you can create a similar one.

I have had this domain for around a year by the time of writing but all the plans I've had for it over the last few months never came to be (personal file server, email server, etc...). Right now, I'm glad those plans/project ideas never resulted in anything that used this domain because I'm enjoying writing quite a lot.

The idea of creating a blog came from a [friend of mine](https://educorreia932.dev) that was starting to play around with some **html+css** and **java script** on his personal web page. It was a small page with a cute spinning backdrop (the backdrop is controllable now).  
Anyway, I started by going through a few tutorials at [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_website.asp) and was making some progress when I started thinking about how I was going to host this thing.

## GitHub pages and hosting

This is where [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) comes in. Since I was looking to deploy a simple **personal static** page, [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) sounded like a great solution (I remembered it from hosting the presentation slides for a [Python 3 workshop](https://github.com/JoaoCostaIFG/Workshop-Introduction-Python-3) I lectured).  
Hosting it sounded much scarier than it actually is/was. I followed the following steps:

- First, you create a repository for your website. Since I wanted it to be my personal website, I named it like instructed on the [github pages](https://pages.github.com) page, so *joaocostaifg.github.io* in my case. It can be either private or public, you choose.

- After that, you go to your newly created github repository settings (probably at `github.com/user/user.github.io/settings`, where `user` is your github username) and activate **github pages function**. On the next steps, I'm gonna talk about using a custom domain, so the next steps and optional (if you don't have/don't want to use a custom domain, you're done with the hosting matter)
- Now that we've activated the **github pages function**, we can give it our domain in the **custom domain section**. In my case, this is `joaocosta.dev`. As you can see from the image below, the repository can be private.

- This is the part that confused me a bit (I had no idea it worked like this). You need to go to your domain registrar's website and access your domain's DNS setting. When you're there, you need to create **4 A records** with the following **IP addresses** and optionally, a **CNAME Record** (185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153). The **CNAME Record** seems to improve [page loading times](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#www-subdomains) among other things (also, **www** seems to be the common and recommended choice). I bought my domain at [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com) so my DNS settings' page look like this:

- It should be all good now :D. Remember that if you're using a custom domain, it might take a few hours for your certificate to be issued.

Now the fun part begins :3

## Static page generators

I'm not sure if you noticed, but there is a **Theme Chooser** field on the github pages repository settings. While hosting the page I was working on at the time (it was a simples html+css page that looked similar to [this page](https://suckless.org), I noticed those theme options and got curious, so I went to check it out.  
Turn out that there are a few **static page generators** nowadays, and they are extremely popular. I started looking at some of the options and the most popular seemed to be [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I picked up [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) because the logo looked cute.

To be honest, when I started thinking about creating my own blog, I never expected I'd end up using a static page generator (especially considering I didn't know they existed) but here I am. It still feels a bit like cheating because they make the process of creating a web page extremely easy (especially considering all the [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io) freely available online) but I'll probably get over it when I start editing the [theme that I'm using](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-terminal) (gotta feel like I did something :/).

Anyway, using HUGO has been super simple and fun. It's easy to write in markdown and HUGO has tons of features. I thought about talking about how I started using it but I don't think I can do a better job at explaining stuff than this 2 guides: [HUGO Quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start) and [HUGO Host on Github](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github).  
BTW HUGO is cool but Jekyll looked amazing too. Just pick the one you like the most or try both (I'm too lazy to try both and I'm fairly happy with HUGO *for now*).  
Oh ye, there's also automatically set up RSS feeds with HUGO (it's under **Show more** on the bar at the top).

### My 'deploy' script

On the [HUGO Host on Github](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github) there's a script called `deploy.sh` that is used to commit the website builds to the website's repository (using **git submodules**). I had a problem with this script when deleting pages because they weren't removed from the final build automatically, so I adapted it to my needs. This is the script I'm using right now:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# If a command fails then the deploy stops
set -e

printf "\033[0;32mDeploying updates to GitHub...\033[0m\n"

# Delete old files
cd public
for i in $(find . -maxdepth 1 ! -name . ! -name .. ! -name '.git' ! -name 'CNAME'); do
  rm -r "$i"
done
cd ..

# Build the project.
hugo

# Go To Public folder
cd public

# Add changes to git.
git add .

# Commit changes.
msg="rebuilding site $(date)"
if [ -n "$*" ]; then
  msg="$*"
fi
git commit -m "$msg"

# Push source and build repos.
git push origin master
```

This script deletes the old build files (only keeps the **CNAME file** needed by github pages and the **.git** file/directory (it's a file in case we're using submodule)), builds the website and commits the final build. Feel free to use it and change it your needs.

## Closing remarks

Everything seems to be set up to work smoothly from now on, so I'll most likely start posting more frequently. The most important thing I need to find now is a tool to check my grammar i.e. if the sentences are constructed correctly (I'm open to suggestions).

And with this, I end my first real blog post. Feels like this project is going to be fun.  
Stay safe :P

## EDIT (2020-02-23)

I started using a `Makefile` to work and deploy the website, instead of my **deploy script**. After I finished writting my [**PlantUML** post](/content/blog/plantuml.html), I decided to edit this post to include it.

```bash
# your output directory (e.g.: public)
OUTPUT_DIR = public
# your website url (e.g.: www.joaocosta.dev)
CNAME = www.joaocosta.dev

default: server

.PHONY: clean
clean:
  @echo "cleaning"
  @# clean all files (except hidden files like '.git')
  rm -rf ${OUTPUT_DIR}/*
  mkdir -p ${OUTPUT_DIR}
  @# write the CNAME file
  printf "%s" ${CNAME} > ${OUTPUT_DIR}/CNAME

.PHONY: build
build:
  @echo "building"
  hugo -d ${OUTPUT_DIR}

.PHONY: commit
commit:
  git -C ${OUTPUT_DIR} add -A
  git -C ${OUTPUT_DIR} commit -m "Deploy: $(shell date)"
  git -C ${OUTPUT_DIR} push origin master

.PHONY: deploy
deploy: clean build commit

.PHONY: server
server:
  hugo -D server
```
