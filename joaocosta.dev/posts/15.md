My take on that popular youtuber/internet personality trope where they list the games/movies/etc. they liked the most during the year.

## Preamble

I'm usually not one to be late to a party, but it's already March and I haven't published anything this year. I was thinking about publishing a blog post per week this year, but I'm not sure that will happen (as usual for new year's resolutions).

Anyway, I want to talk a bit about the games, movies, etc. that I liked the most last year. Maybe you find something you find interesting here.

## Games

This year I played some of my old favorites again. The main one was [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/). I've playing this game on/off for the last 10 years. After a 2 year long pause, I spent close to 4 months catching up in Warframe. According to Steam, these 4 months amount to 72% of my 2024's playtime in Warframe. Once you get going, it's a really nice game to play alone or with friends. I just love coming up with new builds/loadouts and I think the game is in a great place for that. Warframe is the game I think about when someone mentions *labour of love*.

Then, Elden Ring's DLC was released ([Shadow of the Erdtree](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/)), so I went back to that game. It was a nice experience. It's a shame it was released on a period where I was a bit short on time. Still, I really enjoyed the new bosses and the story.

Now back to replaying games, after the DLC was over, I still had that _urge_ to play a souls-like, so I went through the whole Dark Souls series once again. This time I payed extra attention to the second installment of the series. That game always had a special place in my heart, but this time it might have become my favorite in the series. Spent some time getting the _achievement_ of beating the game without dying or resting at bonefires. Hard, but a rewarding experience.

After this trip through the souls-like land, I went to play some indie games. I played [Dicey Dungeons](https://store.steampowered.com/app/861540/Dicey_Dungeons/), [9 Years of Shadows](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1402120/9_Years_of_Shadows/), [Mosa Lina](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477090/Mosa_Lina), and [Lunacid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1745510/Lunacid/). Lunacid definitelly steals the crown here: such a great game. It really had me glued to my computer for 3 or 4 days. Highly recommend this one. Also, give Mosa Lina a try if you like puzzles and platformers.

## Anime

I didn't really watch that much anime last year. I went back to reading manga and light novels: feels like reading suits me better than watching. Still, besides movies, the anime series that I enjoyed the most in 2024 was [Pet](https://anilist.co/anime/101350/pet/). I started watching almost by mistake, but the story really captivated me. Watched it all in one go. Then there was [My Deer Friend Nokotan](https://anilist.co/anime/175977/My-Deer-Friend-Nokotan/) laughed a lot with this one.

I'll also include anime movies here, so I can fill this section:

- [A Whisker Away](https://anilist.co/anime/114963/A-Whisker-Away/) - Incredibly fun to watch.
- [LOOK BACK](https://anilist.co/anime/174788/LOOK-BACK/) - A very personal touching story.
- [5 centimeters per second](https://anilist.co/anime/1689/5-Centimeters-per-Second/) - Great mix of fun and sad.
- [Junkers Come Here](https://anilist.co/anime/1116/Junkers-Come-Here/) - Another incredibly touching story told in a very creative way.

## Manga/Light novels

I've watched the first season of [Mushoku Tensei](https://anilist.co/anime/108465/Mushoku-Tensei-Jobless-Reincarnation/) a couple of years ago. Got interested in the story, so I started reading the manga. Turns out that the manga isn't much further ahead than the anime. As such, I started reading the light novel. I haven't read a light novel in years, but Mushoku Tensei was great. A bit unconfortable at times, but it picked my interest like no other. I still have 5 volumes or so to go through, but I'm taking a pause for a bit.

Then I went through phase where I was feeling like reading, so I read a bunch of manga and manhwa. Mostly shorter older stuff. I liked [Kitanai Kimi ga Ichiban Kawaii](https://anilist.co/manga/110396/Kitanai-Kimi-ga-Ichiban-Kawaii/) and [Solanin](https://anilist.co/manga/33731/Solanin/) (for very different reasons). Don't read the first one if sexual violence bothers you.

## Movies

I have never watched as many movies as I did in 2024. In no particular order, these where the ones I liked the most:

- [The Hunting of the Snark](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22171734/) - the story doesn't make any sense, but it is still fun to watch (which I find interesting).
- [Lady Bird](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4925292/) - I'm definitely not the target audience for this one, but I think it handled its themes well.
- [The Father](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10272386/) - From the personal references I have, I found it to be good portrayal of having a family member go through dementia/alzeimher's.

## Music

This year I've been exploring a bit more music. I've found some artists that I enjoyed and I never heard before:

- [Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCxZC5_qm0HDLRxt53Yy4XWw) - This isn't exactly my style of music, but I enjoyed some of their work.
- [Wolf Alice](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UC0pJ-obBdqkyhBUvmXt646A) - I got hooked on their _Silk_ track and went from there. They're great.
- [Dry Cleaning](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCoSgLAvtgQVCxO6Wt5vwEeA) - One of the most unique bands I know. They quickly became one of my favorites.

As usual, the groups I've listed to the most were [MÃ£o Morta](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UC5FgqTje8qUT0JfBbfXiq1Q) and [Linda Martini](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCb7eRocd4u0kseO_M2PFmag). Although both groups released new albums in 2025, some songs of the new albums were released in 2024. In my opinion, they keep getting better and better.

## Conclusion

I wanted to share some appreciation for these things with the world, so I quickly put this together. Hope you find something cool in this list.

Stay safe :P
