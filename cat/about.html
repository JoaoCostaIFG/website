    <h2>Hello c:</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a computer engineering student at the
      <a href="https://fe.up.pt"
        >Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto</a
      >
      and this is my personal website/blog.<br />
      I created this website to share/talk about things that I feel like talking
      about so this isn't strictly a technology/informatics blog.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The programming languages I'm most comfortable with are
      <b>Bash/POSIX shell</b> (if we can call shell scripts programming
      languages), <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>java</b> and <b>Python3</b>, but I
      also have some experience with <b>ARMv7/8 assembly</b>, <b>C#</b>,
      <b>Pascal</b>, <b>VB.Net</b> and <b>javascript</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy playing games, reading, listening to music, and
      working on personal projects (which usually revolve around customizing my
      Linux machines) <i>(I use Arch BTW)</i>.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a firm supporter of the sovereignty of people's data (<b>privacy</b>),
      <a href="https://www.fsf.org">free software</a> (or at least open-source
      software) and the <a href="https://repair.eu">right to repair</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally speaking, I don't like social media so I try to stay as far away
      from it as possible. This is mostly due to privacy concerns but also
      because I believe it is harmful to the human psyche. I liked this
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjbyDU0WzYI">video</a> by
      <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a> about the topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't want to share my face on the website (at least for the time being)
      so I'll use the profile picture I use in most places, which you can see
      below. This drawing was based on the Desert Skate "Floof" decoration from
      the game <a href="https://www.warframe.com">Warframe</a> and it was drawn
      by someone very dear to me who goes by the pseudonym <b>o̶̅̑n̵̓͒i̷̋͆</b> (use of
      the image by other entities is <b>not</b> permitted).
