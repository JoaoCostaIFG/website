# JoaoCostaIFG my blog

The source files of my [blog/personal webstie](https://joaocosta.dev).

## Contents of this repository

This repository includes all (currently published) content of my personal
website/blog and the tools I use to write and publish it.

## The tools I use to publish

I use a Makefile and some shell scripts (all POSIX compliant) to build the
pages and deploy them. I also use python to host a local server to preview
changes while I'm writing.  
Some scripts are dumb, others are cool. At the time of writing, they are not
documented/commented, but I believe they are readable enough. I don't expect
this tools to be useful for anyone else, but if you're curious, they're
[here](/build_res/scripts).
