<h2>Welcome to my personal webs page/blog</h2>

My name is Jo√£o Costa and this is my personal corner of the internet.

<h3><a href="/content/blog.html">Blog posts</a></h3>

You can find the index of my blog posts <a href="/content/blog.html">here</a>.

<h3><a href="https://wiki.joaocosta.dev">Wiki</a></h3>

I manage a small <a href="https://wiki.joaocosta.dev">wiki</a> with a friend of
mine where we post small "cookbooks", "cheatsheets" and other general
guides/annotations about things we've had to work/deal with in the past and
would like to have an easy to follow guide in the future. Editing of the wiki is
restricted to us but you reading is public. We host a
<a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki">Dokuwiki</a>
instance for it.
