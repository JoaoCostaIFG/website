    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Hey! My name is Jo√£o Costa and this is my personal corner of the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm interested in computer science and electronics, and I enjoy implementing my own solutions to problems/needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page's main focus is for me to share some ideas/processes behind projects that I've worked on.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="https://wiki.joaocosta.dev">Wiki</a></h2>
    <p>
      I manage a small <a href="https://wiki.joaocosta.dev">wiki</a> with a couple of friends where we post small
      "cookbooks", "cheat-sheets" and other general guides/annotations. These focus on things we've had to work/deal
      with in the past and would like to have an easy-to-follow guide in the future. Although editing of the wiki is
      restricted, reading is public to everyone. The wiki is powered by <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki">Dokuwiki</a>.
