Hello c:

I'm a computer engineering student at the [Faculty of Engineering of the
University of Porto](https://fe.up.pt) and this is my personal
website/blog.  
I created this website to share/talk about things that I feel like talking
about so this isn't strictly a technology/informatics blog.

I'm experienced at programming in **Bash/POSIX shell**, **C**, **C++**, and **Python3**,
but I also have some experience with **ARMv7/8 assembly**, **C#**, **Pascal** and
**VB.Net**.  
I'm currently learning **html**, **css** and **javascript** (I know html and css
aren't programming languages).

In my free time, I enjoy playing games, reading, listening to music, and working
on personal projects (which usually revolve around customizing my Linux machines)
_(I use Arch BTW)_.

I support the following: sovereignty of people's data (**privacy**),
**[free software](https://www.fsf.org)** (or at least open-source software)
and the **[right to repair](https://repair.eu/)**.

Generally speaking, I don't like social media so I try to stay as far away from it
as possible. This is mostly due to privacy concerns but also because I believe it
is harmful to the human psyche. I liked this youtube
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjbyDU0WzYI)
by **[Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/)** about the topic.

I don't want to share my face on the website (at least for now) so I'll use
the profile picture I use in most places, which you can see below. This drawing was
based on the Desert Skate Floof decoration from the game **[Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/)**
and it was drawn by someone very dear to me who goes by the pseudonym **o̶̅̑n̵̓͒i̷̋͆**
(use of the image by other entities is **not** permitted).
