<h2>The recipe for my favorite cake</h2>

My grandmother likes baking this simple cake when she has grandchildren over. It
is simple and super quick to bake. For this recipe, we need:
<ul>
  <li>8 eggs</li>
  <li>1.5 cups of sugar</li>
  <li>2.5 cups flour</li>
  <li>1.5 cups of milk</li>
  <li>Small spoon of yeast</li>
</ul>

We mix all these ingredients and bake it for 55 minutes at 180 degrees in the
oven (not-preheated).<br />
Note: You can easily multiply/divide the quantities of ingredients to adapt the
size of the cake. Have fun and stay safe.
