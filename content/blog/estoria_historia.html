<h2>Estória vs. história</h2>

<br />
<h3>First, a bit of context</h3>
<p>
  Recently, I made a great friend. We have been talking frequently for almost
  two months now and it has been great. She is a fantastic girl. After some days
  of talking, I noticed something interesting. She is the first Portuguese
  friend I have with whom I talk mostly through private messages.<br />
  Up until now, I have almost exclusively used VoIP services to talk with my
  close friends. For me, private messages have always been something used only
  for short, occasional conversations, e.g.: asking where/when to meet up.
</p>

<br />
<h3>Why I'm talking about this</h3>
<p>
  It is fairly usual for us to tell stories to one another when we're 'talking'
  and this raised a problem for me when writing: should I say
  <i>estória</i> or <i>história</i>?<br />
  I remembered my 12th grade Portuguese telling me about a mistake I had made in
  one of the tests. I didn't know about the word <i>estória</i>, so I didn't use
  it correctly. He told me that <i>estória</i> referred to a narrative or
  fiction and <i>história</i> to something factual that happened in a
  society/the world and the science that studies that (just like 'story' and
  'history').
</p>
<p>
  So, in English, we have the words 'story' and 'history', and in Portuguese, we
  have the roughly equivalent words <i>estória</i> and <i>história</i>. Case
  solved?
</p>

<h4>No, the case isn't solved</h4>
<p>
  Even with all this, there was still one question left to answer: why did I
  never see people using this word when it should be used?
</p>
<p>
  Obviously, I didn't go around telling people to use the correct word because
  that would be impolite and I wasn't sure if I was right given the
  circumstance. With this, I never really learned the <b>truth</b> about these
  two words :/, so I turned to a dictionary and the Internet.
</p>

<h4>The dictionaries didn't help</h4>
<p>
  I have two Portuguese dictionaries at my mom's place, so I went to pick them
  up and took the opportunity to pay a visit to the rest of the family.<br />
  I started by taking a look at the blue one. It was the bigger one with around
  twice as many words as the orange one (the smaller one). In this dictionary,
  <i>estória</i> wasn't listed and <i>história</i> covered both of the meanings
  I was looking for: narrative and fiction, and facts of the past and the
  science them. This explained why I never saw people using the word
  <i>estória</i>.<br />
  After that, I picked up the orange dictionary and, to my surprise, it listed
  both
  <i>estória</i> and <i>história</i> with the respective meanings I was
  expecting from the beginning. What the <b>bleep</b>?¿ (I've always found
  upside down question marks funny).
</p>
<p>
  Besides the colors and sizes, there was one more notable difference between my
  two dictionaries: there are almost <b>10 years</b> between their edition dates
  and there was a controversial <b>spelling agreement</b> between those two
  dates.<br />
  Could <i>estória</i> be a new word?
</p>

<h4>Time to surf the web</h4>
<p>
  Well, I didn't need to search very far to get an answer to this question from
  a reliable source. Both
  <i><a href="https://dicionario.priberam.org/estória">estória</a></i> and
  <i><a href="https://dicionario.priberam.org/história">história</a></i>
  exist, and they are both derived from the Latin word
  <b>historía</b>.<br />
  <i>Estória</i>
  <a href="https://www.flip.pt/Duvidas-Linguisticas/Duvida-Linguistica/DID/457"
    >isn't a new word</a
  >. It is just not wildly accept by Portuguese scholars/dictionaries, so the
  most reliable sources either say that <i>estória</i> has the
  <a href="https://www.infopedia.pt/dicionarios/lingua-portuguesa/estória"
    >same meaning as <i>historía</i></a
  >
  or that
  <a href="https://dicionario.priberam.org/estória"
    >it means the same as English's 'story'</a
  >.<br />
  Between all this confusion, there are two things that the dictionaries seem to
  have agreed on: <i>estória</i> shouldn't be used given all the controversy and
  <i>historía</i> has kept its full, original meaning (meaning both 'story' and
  'history'). This makes <i>estória</i> unneeded.
</p>

<br />
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  I have to admit I'm a bit angry that my 12th grade teacher gave me a lower
  grade because of something like this. Knowing that teacher, I'm surprised he
  supported a new word like this. I'd say he probably didn't know where it came
  from, otherwise I'm sure he'd flip out at anyone that used it.
</p>
<p>
  I think I'm going to go back to always saying/writing <i>história</i>. It's
  safer and sounds better.
  <i>Good thing I didn't go around 'correcting' people about this topic</i
  >.<br />
  Hope you enjoyed this small journey over the Portuguese language :3.

<h3>Closing notes</h3>
<p>
  I've started using
  <a href="https://languagetool.org/">LanguageTool</a> with
  <a href="https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale">ALE</a> for <b>vim</b>, which
  gave me the perfect excuse to go over my <b>vim</b> configuration files and
  clean stuff up. I've also tried some more technical prose/text
  <b>linters</b> like
  <a href="https://github.com/btford/write-good">write-good</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/redpen-cc/redpen">RedPen</a> but they too strict
  for the style of writing I want to do. Still, I think I will use
  <a href="https://github.com/redpen-cc/redpen">RedPen</a> when writing text in
  programming projects, e.g.: Doxygen documentation and README.md files.<br />
  So ye, now that my prose-writing setup is working, I decided to push this blog
  idea to the <i>top of pile</i> so I could try it out. It appears to be working
  just like it should.
</p>
<p>
  One more thing. I'll be trying my best to keep the <b>tags</b> at the top
  consistent over the time, so if you want to see all my posts related to a
  given <b>tag</b>, you can just click it. Maybe I'll create a page to
  group/list all the <b>tags</b> I use. This way, they can be easily accessed at
  all times.<br />
  Stay safe :P
