      I'm a twenty-something year old computer engineering student at the
      <a href="https://fe.up.pt">Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto</a>
      and this is my personal website.<br>
      I started this website so I could learn more about web development and have
      a place to share my experiences, mostly relating to programming although not
      necessarly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've dealt with numerous programming languages, but I am
      the most confortable with the following: <b>Bash/POSIX shell</b>,
      <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>Python3</b>, and <b>Zig</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy playing games, reading, listening to music, and
      working on personal projects, which usually revolve around customizing my
      Linux machines <i>(I use Arch BTW)</i>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a supporter of the sovereignty of people's data (<b>privacy</b>),
      <a href="https://www.fsf.org">free software</a> (or at least open-source
      software) and the <a href="https://repair.eu">right to repair</a>.<br>
      Generally speaking, I don't like social media so I try to stay as far away
      from it as possible. This is mostly due to privacy concerns but also because I
      believe it is harmful to the human psyche. You can contact me using the following
      email address: <b>joaocosta.work@posteo.net</b>.
